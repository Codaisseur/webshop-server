Routes for:

- GET /products - get me all the products
- GET /categories (probably including the products)

## frontend:

- Set up create-react-app
- Set up redux boilerplate and first reducer slice
- Create first page skeleton (product list)
- Make or make use of routes and get some data to the front end,
  make a request and check with consolelog we are getting the data in the front end
- Get data to redux state
- get it to the page skeleton and log it also
- Once data is in the component, start building the UI.
